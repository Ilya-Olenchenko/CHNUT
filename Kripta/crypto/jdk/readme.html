<a name="introduction"><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
<blockquote>
Thank you for downloading this release of the 
Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 2 SDK, Standard Edition 
(J2SE<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup>). 
The Java&nbsp;2 SDK is a development environment for building applications, 
applets, and components that can be deployed on implementations 
of the Java&nbsp;2 Platform. 
<p>
The Java 2 SDK includes tools useful for developing and 
testing programs written in the Java programming language and running on 
the Java platform. These tools are designed to be used from the command 
line. Except for appletviewer, these tools do not provide a graphical user
interface.
<p>
The Java 2 SDK includes the Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> 
Plug-in product. You can use the Java Plug-in to enable the Internet 
Explorer and Netscape Navigator browsers to run applets based on the 
Java&nbsp;2 platform.

<a name="docs"><h2>Documentation</h2></a>
<blockquote>
This section describes the documentation provided with the original 
J2SE 1.3.0 release. That documentation is applicable to J2SE 1.3.0_02 
as well.  For information on bug fixes in J2SE 1.3.0_02, see 
the online <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/ReleaseNotes.html">release 
notes</a>.
<p>

The on-line <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/index.html">Java&nbsp;2 SDK Documentation</a> 
contains API specifications, developer guides, reference pages for 
SDK tools and utilities, 
demos, and links to related information.  This documentation is also 
available in a download bundle which you can install locally with your 
Java 2 SDK software.  To obtain the documentation bundle, see the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs.html">documentation download page</a>.
<p>
For API documentation, refer to the following sources:
	<ul>
<p><li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/index.html">The Java&nbsp;2 Platform API Specification</a>

This provides brief descriptions of the API with
an emphasis on specifications, not on examples.

<p><li><i><a href=http://java.sun.com/docs/books/chanlee/>The
Java Class Libraries</a></i>, Second Edition, published by
Addison-Wesley Longman as part of 
<a href=http://java.sun.com/docs/books/>The Java Series</a>.
These volumes include much more elaborate descriptions,
with definitions of terminology and examples for classes, interfaces 
and members in ten core packages.
</ul>
</blockquote>

<a name="system"><h2>System Requirements</h2></a>
<blockquote>
    The Java&nbsp;2 SDK is intended for use on Windows 95, Windows 98, 
    Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 2000 operating systems running 
    on Intel hardware, with the following additional requirements and 
    recommendations:
<p><blockquote>
     A Pentium 166MHz or faster processor.  At least 
    32 megabytes of physical RAM is required to run GUI applications. 
    Forty-eight megabytes is recommended for applets running within a 
    browser using the Java Plug-in product. Running with less memory may 
    cause disk swapping which has a severe effect on performance. Very 
    large programs may require more RAM for adequate performance. 
</blockquote>

<p>You should have 65 megabytes of free disk space before
attempting to install the Java 2 SDK software. If you also install the 
separate documentation download bundle, you need an additional 120 megabytes 
of free disk space. 

<p>
The Java&nbsp;2 SDK is localized for Japanese.  For more information, see
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/japan-notes.html">Japanese 
localization notes</a>.

<a name="install"><h2>Installation</h2></a>
<blockquote>
The complete Java 2 SDK is composed of the SDK software plus the 
SDK documentation, each of which is separately downloadable.  
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/install-windows.html">Installation 
instructions</a> for each release are maintained on the Java Software web site.

</blockquote>

<p>
<a name=relnotes><h2>Release Notes</h2></a>
<blockquote>

See the <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/ReleaseNotes.html>Release 
Notes</a> on the Java Software web site for additional  
information pertaining to this release. 
The on-line release notes will be updated as needed, so you should check 
it occasionally for the latest information.

</blockquote>


<a name=compatibility><h2>Compatibility</h2></a>
<blockquote>

<p>
See <a href=http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/compatibility.html>
Compatibility with Previous Releases</a> on the Java Software web site 
for the list of known compatibility issues. Every effort has been made to 
support programs written for previous version of the Java platform. 
Although some 
incompatible changes were necessary, most software should migrate to 
current version with no reprogramming.  Any failure to do so is 
considered a bug, except for a small number of cases where compatibility 
was deliberately broken, as described on our compatibility page. Some
compatibility-breaking changes were required to close potential
security holes or to fix implementation or design bugs.
<p>

<h2>The Java 2 Runtime Environment</h2></a>
<blockquote>

      The <b>Java 2 Runtime Environment</b> allows you to run applications  
      written in the Java programming language.  Like the Java 2 SDK, it 
      contains the Java virtual machine, classes comprising 
      the Java 2 Platform API, and 
      supporting files. Unlike the Java 2 SDK, it does not contain 
      development tools such as compilers and debuggers. 
      <p>
      You can freely redistribute the Java 2 Runtime Environment 
      with your application, according to the terms of the Runtime 
      Environment's license. Once you have developed your application using 
      the Java 2 SDK, you can ship it with the Runtime Environment so 
      your end-users will have a 1.3-based Java platform on which to run your 
      software.
      <p>
      Note that the Java 2 SDK has an internal implementation of 
      a Java runtime environment for its own use. This internal runtime 
      environment is contained in the SDK's <tt>jre</tt> directory. 
      Don't confuse the SDK's internal runtime environment with the 
      Java 2 Runtime Environment, which is a separately installable 
      product.
      <p>
      The Java 2 Runtime Environment requires additional 
      software -- the Java Plug-in software -- to enable it to run applets in 
      a browser. The Win32 version of the Java 2 Runtime Environment 
      includes the Java 2 Plug-in software.
 
<p>

      The <b>Java Plug-in</b> software allows Java applets and JavaBeans
      components to run in a browser using Sun's Java 2 Runtime
      Environment instead of the browser's default Java environment. 
      The Java Plug-in works with Netscape Navigator and Microsoft
      Internet Explorer.    
      For documentation and an FAQ on the Java Plug-in, see
      <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin">Java Plug-in</a>.
      <p>
      After the plug-in is installed, 
      you will see that the Java Plug-in control panel has been 
      added to your Windows Control Panel. Look for the Duke icon 
      label "Java Plug-in".  The 
      plug-in will automatically load the Java&nbsp;2 Runtime 
      Environment when the browser loads an HTML page with a special 
      &lt;OBJECT&gt; HTML tag. The browser can then load applets from this
      page to make full use of 1.3 features.  For details on how to 
      configure your HTML pages
      to invoke the Java 2 Runtime Environment, see "Documentation" at Sun's
      <a href=http://java.sun.com/products/plugin/>Java Plug-in website</a>.

<p>
      For information about Java Plug-in enhancements in this 1.3.0_01, 
      see also the 
      <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3.0_01/docs/index.html">Java 
      Plug-in documenation</a> for this release.
